euler-problems
==============

This is a collection of my scripts to solve problems on Project Euler using R. I am slowly adding the solutions
I have come up with so far. However, rather than just post some code I want to post extensively commented
code where I discuss the rationale behind what I am doing, any improvements that I could make (not necesaarily
the BEST improvements), and hopefully acknowledging what is bad practice in R and trying to avoid it.

I like to in include lots of timing information for different algorithmns so we can compare and contrast 
algorithmns. Sometimes I might make a slower algorithm because it is more flexible in handling larger input data
etc.

Anyway, this is mainly here for my own fulfilment in problem solving and coding practice using R! Feel free to
improve some of my somewhat flaky algo's! 

P.S. I hope any of the meagre number of people who visit this repo will realise that there is no enjoyment in
simply using one of these scripts to obtain the answer to a problem to post to the website. This is why I have
not included the answers in any code output. Please don't be tempted. Use these to engineer your own (much better)
solutions.
